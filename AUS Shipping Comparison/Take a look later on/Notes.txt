It appears there was an oversight in handling the orders where the shipping cost is presented only once per Name, despite having multiple SKUs. To address this:

Mathematical Calculation of the 8.40% Increase
Median Required Increase Percentage: 10.23%
Weighted Average Required Increase Percentage: 6.56%
Adjusted Increase Percentage: (Median + Weighted Average) / 2
Adjusted Increase Percentage
=

Adjusted Increase Percentage=

 =8.40%


Coverage Analysis with 8.40% Increase
Total Orders: 660
Orders Covering Shipping Costs: 300
Orders Not Covering Shipping Costs: 360
Coverage Ratio: 45.45%

Observations:
High Shipping Costs Relative to Subtotal:

Smaller orders have shipping costs that constitute a significant portion of their subtotals.
The adjusted increase does not sufficiently cover the shipping costs for these orders.
Non-Covered Orders:

All sample smaller orders still do not cover their shipping costs even after applying the 8.40% increase.


High Hypothetical Increase Percentages: Smaller orders often require a significant increase percentage (ranging from approximately 11% to over 21%) to cover their shipping costs.

Recommendations for Smaller Orders:
Minimum Order Value for Free Shipping: Implement a minimum order value to qualify for free shipping, encouraging larger orders.
